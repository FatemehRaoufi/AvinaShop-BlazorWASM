# AvinaShop (BlazorWASM)
**Current Status:** In Development

## Description
AvinaShop is an e-commerce web application built using Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) and .NET 9. The project uses Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for database interaction and follows Clean Code and SOLID principles to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Features
- **Admin Panel:** Manage products, orders, and users.
- **Homepage with Search and Filter functionality:** Allows users to easily search and filter products in real-time without reloading the page.
- **Shopping Process:** A complete shopping process from product selection to checkout.
- **Infinite Scroll:** Progressive product loading for enhanced user experience (e.g., "Load More" button).
- **Add to Cart with Immediate Feedback:** Adds products to the cart with real-time success or error notifications using toast messages.
- **Identity Authentication:** User authentication with role-based access control.
- **Role-Based Access:** Manage user roles and permissions.
- **Reactive UI for Filtering:**
   - Real-time filtering by product name and category selection without reloading the page.
   - Provides a fast and responsive search and filter experience.
     
## Technologies Used
- **Blazor (WASM):** To build an interactive web application running in the browser.
- **.NET 9:** The latest version of the .NET framework for backend development.
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core):** For database interaction.
- **Clean Code:** To maintain a clear and maintainable codebase.
- **SOLID Principles:** For a flexible, extendable, and maintainable architecture.
- **xUnit:** For unit testing repository methods to ensure correct data access logic.

## Recent Updates
1. **Refactored Product Loading with Client-Side Pagination:**
   - Products are now loaded in pages with a "Load More" functionality.
   - This reduces initial load time and improves user experience by progressively fetching more products.

2. **Implemented Infinite Scroll:**
   - Added support for infinite scrolling using a "Load More" button to fetch more products as the user scrolls, providing a smooth browsing experience.

3. **Refactored Add to Cart Logic Using Message-Based Abstraction:**
   - Decoupled cart update logic into a message-based system using `AddToCartMessage`.
   - This change improves code readability, testability, and modularity.
   - Real-time feedback is provided via toast messages for success or error events when adding items to the cart.

## Testing
The project includes a Test Project built with xUnit, focusing on testing the repository methods to ensure that the data access logic is functioning correctly.


## üîß Implementation Details

### üõí OrderService ‚Äì Order Management with Role-Based Access

The `OrderService` class is responsible for managing order-related operations such as retrieving and updating orders. It leverages `ClaimsPrincipal` to identify the currently authenticated user and adjusts access based on the user's role.

### Key Features:
- **Role-Based Order Retrieval**:  
  - **Admin users** can view all orders.  
  - **Regular users** can only view their own orders.
  
- **Claims-Based User Identification**:  
  Retrieves the current user's ID using `ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier` from the `ClaimsPrincipal`.

- **Status Update Support**:  
  Allows updating order status along with an optional session ID for tracking.

### Code Highlights:

**Retrieve Orders Based on Role:**
```csharp
public async Task<IEnumerable<OrderHeader>> GetOrderHeadersAsync()
{
    var user = await GetCurrentUserAsync();

    if (user.IsInRole(AppConstants.Role_Admin))
    {
        return await GetAllOrdersAsync();
    }

    var userId = GetUserId(user);
    return await GetUserOrdersAsync(userId);
}
```
Get Current User ID Using Claims:

```csharp
private string GetUserId(ClaimsPrincipal user)
{
    return user.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value ?? string.Empty;
}
```
Authentication Integration:

```csharp
private async Task<ClaimsPrincipal> GetCurrentUserAsync()
{
    var authState = await _authenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
    return authState.User;
}
```
### üîê AuthenticationService ‚Äì Authentication Handling with Claims

The `AuthenticationService` class is responsible for managing authentication-related operations, such as checking if a user is authenticated and retrieving the user's ID. It utilizes `AuthenticationStateProvider` to retrieve the user's authentication state and work with claims for user identification.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication Check**:  
  Asynchronously checks if the current user is authenticated by verifying the authentication state.

- **User ID Retrieval**:  
  Retrieves the user's unique ID (`NameIdentifier`) from the authentication claims, allowing for user-specific functionality.

### Code Highlights:

**Check if the User is Authenticated:**
```csharp
public async Task<bool> IsAuthenticatedAsync()
{
    var authState = await _authenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();

    if (authState.User.Identity == null)
    {
        return false;
    }
    return authState.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated;
}
```
Retrieve the User ID from Claims:

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetUserIdAsync()
{
    var authState = await _authenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
    var nameIdentifierClaim = authState.User.FindFirst(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier);

    if (nameIdentifierClaim != null)
    {
        return nameIdentifierClaim.Value;
    }
    return null;
}
```
