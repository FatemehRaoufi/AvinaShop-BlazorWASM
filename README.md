The project includes a Test Project built with xUnit, focusing on testing the repository methods to ensure that the data access logic is functioning correctly.


## üîß Implementation Details

### üõçÔ∏è OrderService ‚Äì Order Management with Role-Based Access


The `OrderService` class is responsible for managing order-related operations such as retrieving and updating orders. It leverages `ClaimsPrincipal` to identify the currently authenticated user and adjusts access based on the user's role.

  - [GetOrderByIdAsync](#getorderbyidasync)
  - [UpdateOrderStatusAsync](#updateorderstatusasync)
  - [CreateOrderAsync](#createorderasync)
- [SOLID Principles](#solid-principles)

### Key Features:
- **Role-Based Order Retrieval**:  
  - **Admin users** can view all orders.  
  - **Regular users** can only view their own orders.
  
- **Claims-Based User Identification**:  
  Retrieves the current user's ID using `ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier` from the `ClaimsPrincipal`.

- **Status Update Support**:  
  Allows updating order status along with an optional session ID for tracking.

### Code Highlights:

**Retrieve Orders Based on Role:**
```csharp
public async Task<IEnumerable<OrderHeader>> GetOrderHeadersAsync()
{
    var user = await GetCurrentUserAsync();

    if (user.IsInRole(AppConstants.Role_Admin))
    {
        return await GetAllOrdersAsync();
    }

    var userId = GetUserId(user);
    return await GetUserOrdersAsync(userId);
}
```
Get Current User ID Using Claims:

```csharp
private string GetUserId(ClaimsPrincipal user)
{
    return user.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier)?.Value ?? string.Empty;
}
```
Authentication Integration:

```csharp
private async Task<ClaimsPrincipal> GetCurrentUserAsync()
{
    var authState = await _authenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
    return authState.User;
}
```

| **SOLID Principle**                       | **Implemented?** | **Notes**                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** | Yes              | The class manages only order-related logic (retrieving, updating orders). No other concerns are handled in this class.                           |
| **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**           | Yes              | The service allows adding new methods without modifying existing ones. New features can be added by extending the service or repository.         |
| **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**   | Yes              | The class can be replaced by another class implementing the `IOrderService` interface without breaking functionality.                            |
| **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** | Yes              | The `IOrderService` interface seems focused on order management. However, as the project grows, it may need to be split into smaller interfaces. |
| **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  | Yes              | Dependencies like `IOrderRepository` and `AuthenticationStateProvider` are injected via constructor, ensuring low coupling and high flexibility. |

## Conclusion
OrderService is a vital part of the order management system in AvinaShop, encapsulating all business logic related to handling orders. It efficiently manages user roles and ensures that only authorized users can view or modify order data. With a solid adherence to SOLID principles, this service is well-structured for future growth and maintainability.

### üîê AuthenticationService ‚Äì Authentication Handling with Claims

The `AuthenticationService` class is responsible for managing authentication-related operations, such as checking if a user is authenticated and retrieving the user's ID. It utilizes `AuthenticationStateProvider` to retrieve the user's authentication state and work with claims for user identification.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication Check**:  
  Asynchronously checks if the current user is authenticated by verifying the authentication state.

- **User ID Retrieval**:  
  Retrieves the user's unique ID (`NameIdentifier`) from the authentication claims, allowing for user-specific functionality.

### Code Highlights:

**Check if the User is Authenticated:**
```csharp
public async Task<bool> IsAuthenticatedAsync()
{
    var authState = await _authenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();

    if (authState.User.Identity == null)
    {
        return false;
    }
    return authState.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated;
}
```
Retrieve the User ID from Claims:

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetUserIdAsync()
{
    var authState = await _authenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();
    var nameIdentifierClaim = authState.User.FindFirst(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier);

    if (nameIdentifierClaim != null)
    {
        return nameIdentifierClaim.Value;
    }
    return null;
}
```
